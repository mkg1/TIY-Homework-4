#Ruby Currency Converter

##Synopsis

This is a simple currency converter written in Ruby. The program takes an original amount of a currency and returns a new amount in a different currency specified by the user.

##How To Use The Currency Converter

The *execute.rb* file will run the program.  The user will be prompted for an initial currency amount.

  *The amount can either be given as an amount with a symbol ($45) or, if just an amount is supplied (45), the user will be prompted for a currency code. This should be entered as a 3 letter code (usd or USD).

The program will then prompt the user for a currency to convert the original amount to.

  *This new currency should be given as a currency symbol (eur or EUR)

Finally, the program will output the amount of new currency that the original amount will be converted to.
